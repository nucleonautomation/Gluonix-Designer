# Gluonix Designer V(1.1)
- Gluonix Designer is a GUI design tool for Python applications that simplifies the process of creating graphical user interfaces using a drag-and-drop approach. This tool is aimed at developers who want to quickly prototype or build Python GUIs without extensive manual coding.

## Features
- Drag-and-Drop Interface: Design your GUI by dragging and dropping components onto a canvas.
- Python Code Generation: Automatically generates Python code based on your GUI design.
- Component Library: Includes a variety of pre-built components such as buttons, labels, input fields, etc.
- Customization: Customize properties and behaviors of components directly through the interface.
- Export to Python: Export your designed GUI to a Python script that can be integrated into your Python project.
